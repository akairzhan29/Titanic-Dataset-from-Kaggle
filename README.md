# Titanic-Dataset-from-Kaggle

These notebooks were written as a base code of a submission for the Kaggle competition "Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster" (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal of the project is to train the machine learning (ML) model to predict passengers who survived the Titanic shipwreck. The model is based on analysis of “features” like passengers’ gender, class etc.

So far the code I wrote uses Support Vector Machines as a classifier. To improve the model I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Hyperparameter tuning.
